# We have 5 project here now that need to be fixed.
# 1. is that we need to implement some codes
# whenever the user decide to input what they decide to do
# like after displaying those list, the command should prompt for
# input from the user to input his/her selection
# then we will implement this so when they pick one or two we can get the
# user information like, name, email, and social account where we can
# follow each other up.
# put in more ideas before implementations
