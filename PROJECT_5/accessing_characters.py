""" Accessing Characters By using Index:
- Python supports both +ve and -ve index.
- +ve index means Left to Right (Forward Direction)
- -ve index means Right to Left (Backward Direction)
E.g: s = 'durga'

"""
s = 'durga'
print(s[0])
print(s[4])
print(s[-1])
print(s[10])

""" NOTE: If we are trying to access characters of a string without of range index then we will get error saying: IndexError"""
