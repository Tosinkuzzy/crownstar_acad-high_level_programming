""" How to define multi-line String Literals?
we can define multi-line String literals by using triple single or double quotes. 
E.g:
    >>> s = '''durga
    software
    solutions'''
    
    We can also use triple quotes to use single quotes or double quotes as symbol inside string literal.

s = "This is'single quote symbol"
s = 'This is\'single quote symbol'
s = "This is ' single quote symbol"
s = 'This is "double quotes symbol'
s = 'The "Python Notes" by "durga" is very helpful'
s = "The 'Python Notes' by 'durga' is very helpful"
s = 'The \ "Python Notes\" by \'durga\' is very helpful'
s = '''The "Python Notes" by 'durga' is very helpful'''
