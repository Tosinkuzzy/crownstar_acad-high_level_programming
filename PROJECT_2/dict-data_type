""" WAP to represent a group of values as key-value pairs then we should go for dict data type.
 E.g d = {101:'mangong',102:'Tosinkuzzy',103:'Crownstar'}. 
Duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated.
 If we are trying to insert an entry with duplicate key then old value will be replaced with new value.
dict is mutable and the order won't be preserved.
