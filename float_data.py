# WAP that uses float values by using decimal form.
# N.B We can represent int values in decimal, binary, octal and hexa decimal forms. BUT we can represent float values ONLY BY USING DECIMAL FORM.
# That is why all the codes we will have below will all have errors.

a = 0B11.01
b = 0o123.456
c = 0X123.456
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
