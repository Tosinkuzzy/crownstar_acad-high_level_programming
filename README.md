[Crownstar Academy - High Level Programming]
This repository contains the projects and assignments for the High Level Programming course at Crownstar Academy.
The course covers the basics of Python programming language, such as data types, control structures, functions, modules, and object-oriented programming.
The course also introduces some advanced topics, such as exceptions, decorators, generators, and unit testing.

[Prerequisites]
To run the Python scripts in this repository, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

[Installation]
To clone this repository, open a terminal and run the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Tosinkuzzy/crownstar_acad-high_level_programming.git

Then, navigate to the directory of the project you want to run and execute the Python script.
 For example, to run the project 0x00-python-hello_world, run the following commands:

cd crownstar_acad-high_level_programming/0x00-python-hello_world
python3 0-run

[Usage]
Each project directory contains a README.md file that explains the objectives, requirements, and tasks of the project.
Each task is a Python script that performs a specific function or demonstrates a concept.
You can run the scripts as described above, or import them as modules in your own Python code. 
For example, to import the script 0-positive_or_negative.py from the project 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions,
you can write the following code:

import sys
sys.path.append('../0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions')
import 0-positive_or_negative

0-positive_or_negative.positive_or_negative(5)
